Genesis 1. The first post. Enviar uno. Whatever you want to call it, this is my first contribution to my new personal site/blog. For the most part, I will be using this website as an online resum√© of sorts, and this blog as a showcase of my projects both past and present.<!--more--> I'm not much of a personality and don't believe I have much to say, so in the interest of brevity, I will try to keep the general "content creator"-esque off-topic posts like this to a minimum.

Since you have managed to find yourself here, I assume you are interested some new reading recommendations; without further ado and in no particular order, my top 10 books to help you design and engineer better products (please note that these books are my personal favorites and heavily pertain to not only programming but also web development, design, and SE as a business... they aren't limited to only hardcore dev stuff, sorry üòê):

<br/>
### Clean Code by Robert Cecil Martin
If you have never been recommended to read this book then you have probably never been on StackOverflow, Medium, or any technical blog. Clean Code is a classic of software engineering and while it is extremely biased, much like its author, its lessons can still be applied today. The book focuses on the techniques that should be employed by developers to create code that not only works but is durable and easy to manage. Clean Code likens software engineers to craftsman and treats programming as a trade that its tradesman should seek to refine and better understand to perform their jobs as best as possible. If you want to be able to take greater pride in your work, this is the book to read. You won't learn a new language and you won't get any code you can paste into your project, but you will be able to argue with other elitest developers on StackOverflow for a change.

### The Mythical Man-month by Fred Brooks
This one is probably my favorite, hands down. Why did I put it second then? Who knows. The Mythical Man-month is an incredibly insightful series of essays by Fred Brooks on the topic of software engineering and project planning. It is safe to assume that you have probably read some of its wisdom on StackOverflow already. If you have ever heard a joke such as "a project manager is someone who believes that 9 women can produce a baby in 1 month" and chuckled, stop what you are doing right now and buy this book (or use a library, most offer immediately downloadable ebooks these days). While this book probably won't teach you how to write a new algorithm or fix your kitchen sink, it will help you better understand time estimation, project scope, and why you will never finish a project on time.

### You Don't Know JS by Kyle Simpson
I love this book series! When working at Thinkful, I would recommend it to every one of my students and it would 100% turbo-charge their learning. If you are new to programming and want the best materials for learning JavaScript, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, look no further. But what if you are a seasoned veteran with years of experience and believe that these books could not possibly contain one shred of information you don't already know? Well, I can almost guarantee you will walk away learning at least something useful about JS by the time you are done reading them (plus you can always skip the introduction volumes).

YDKJS covers everything from what is a variable to how your web browser interprets JS as well as everything in between. It is easy to read, has good examples, is available for FREE on Github <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md" target="_BLANK">here</a>, and also has a <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed" target="_BLANK">new revised 2nd edition</a> coming soon. Whether you don't know what a loop is, you are curious about what happens below the hood when you write JS, or you are a little tardy to the party when it comes to ES6, check these books out!

### User Friendly by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant
An engaging fresh dive into the wonderful albeit rapidly evolving world of user experience design. Recently published in 2019, User Friendly will take you on a journey throughout several decades explaining some of the biggest design innovations and mishaps that occurred along the way.

<br/>
### Blue Ocean Strategy by Ren√©e Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim
While not technically a book about software engineering or even design, Blue Ocean Strategy is an incredible book about creating innovative businesses, which can easily be applied to technology start-ups if that is your thing (it is mine). While the premise of the book seems trivial if explained in a lackluster two to three sentences, the concept of blue vs red oceans will change the way you approach creating new projects, or at the very least, the way you plan on making money with your projects.

So many technology start-ups seem so similar these days and the seemingly successful ones often find themselves chasing each other's tails trying to outdo one another while there is a better way. The proposition of Blue Ocean Strategy is all about navigating your business through the fresh and profitable waters of unpoached markets without wasting your time sitting around trying to think of things that do not currently exist. Ultimately, it is a new way of thinking about existing markets and discovering untapped potential. I know it sounds like a generic business book, but it is a solid read and while it won't make you the next Musk or Zuckerberg, you will definitely take away a few concepts to improve your business strategy.

### The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
This book, originally referred to as POET (The Psychology of Everyday Things), was written by the grandfather of UX and is arguably the most essential read if you wish to further your understanding of user-focused design. While not technically about psychology, hence the name change, the book delves into designing with the users' intentions in mind and seeks to answer the question, what actually is usability? The material has held up and is assisted with practical examples and illustrations.

<br/>
### Web Form Design by Luke Wroblewski
While the literal UI of the examples of this book may no longer be as relevant as they were at the time of publishing, the ideas behind the designs very much are. Written by the legend Luke Wroblewski, a veteran of Yahoo!, eBay, NCSA (not that one), and Google, this book is a treatise into the reason large companies design their forms the way that they do. Each example is backed by research and is focused on data-driven usability techniques and not so much worried with the "sex-appeal" of design.

If you work on front-end at all then you have probably realized that about 90% of the job is building forms. Even when it doesn't feel like you are building a form, you are just building an abstraction of a form. If you want to improve the effectiveness of the forms that you so painstakingly craft, this book will help you understand the principles of how to do that.

<br/>
### Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger
I know what you are thinking: "one design book after another, what the heck Mic?". However, Refactoring UI is a great addition to both Web Form Design and The Design of Everyday Things. If you don't fancy yourself a designer and don't care much for understanding the psychological aspects of user-oriented design theory, Refactoring UI can act as a cheat sheet to help you improve your interfaces. The ebook is structured more like a series of short articles aimed at teaching you clear and simple lessons, with example mockups and straightforward tips to make your interfaces suck less. It is a very quick read and can essentially be used as a glossary of interface components that you can come back to whenever you need some help with a design problem. You will get immediate results with this book and can even get an idea of what you are in for <a href="https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886" target="_BLANK">here</a>.

<br/>
### The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz
Another book that is necessarily a technology book, but The Paradox of Choice and to a greater extent, Barry Schwartz, can greatly impact the way a developer goes about building user-facing projects. If not particularly interested in user interface design practices, but would still like to better understand how to create effective software that solves problems in a simple manner, this one is for you.

<br/>
### The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
Much like Clean Code, The Pragmatic Programmer is a timeless classic often quoted on StackOverflow. Since the book is heavily focused on the philosophy of being a solid developer, its contents haved aged well. To me, this book is much less biased than most development books and gives you the foundation you need to approach programming as more than just coding, which is especially helpful if you are a self-taught developer like myself.

<br/>

So there you have it. I am sorry if the subjective nature of this list doesn't appeal to what you were searching for. These are the types of books that I believe helped me to become better at what I do and I hope that in sharing this list, you will find at least one that interests you (or at least just think that I read a lot and am intelligent).
