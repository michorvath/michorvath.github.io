You have probably heard it before: "always scrap the first pancake." It may just be a side-effect of the American throw away culture creeping into our software development philosophies, nonetheless I am here to bargain in favor of that very cake.<!--more--> To make the absolute assumption that your first attempt at something will never come close to living up to the second attempt, so you should just plan on throwing it out from the beginning is ludicrous.

When making pancakes, the first pancake is often a reflection of the effort and preparation placed into it. When the chef decides to rush and doesn't let the pan heat up before pouring in the batter, or forgets to grease the pan first, or even so turns the heat up to shorten the required cook time; the pancake often comes out lousy.  However, if the same chef properly prepares by preheating the pan greased in anticipation of the batter and keeps a nice low heat for an even albeit longer cook time, the pancake comes out much better on the first try. You could even go as far as to say that using from-scratch batter as opposed to premade box mix affects the quality of the first cake and the subsequent cakes as well.

While I am not arguing that once you have done something, improvements cannot be made on subsequent revisions to better that something â€” I would instead like to propose that we should plan on our projects taking a little longer upfront to create a better first attempt and get away from the assumption of imminent failure. The initial time and effort commitment could actually be saved in the long run.

I still believe we should abide by release dates and constraints, but I also believe it is important that we demystify the idea that our second rushed attempt will be leaps and bounds better than our first rushed attempt. Let's make quality our philosophy from the beginning.
