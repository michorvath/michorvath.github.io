Usability plays a big part in User eXperience but not everyone has a solid grasp on what usability means. While you can clearly define usability in a number of ways, I commonly see it expressed as an intersection between form and function, as plain as user-centered design, or even worse used interchangeably with the term functional.<!--more--> You could argue in defense of those definitions as vague as they can be, however, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring for sake of clarity. Simply put, I believe that **usability at its core is the combination of fluidity, minimalism, and consistency**.

While usability as a whole can be obtained through a process as you have most likely seen from sources much smarter than I (e.g. Jakob Nielsen, Don Norman, or the like). The process involves putting a philosophy into practice, building something, then collecting user feedback. This brief article will focus entirely on the philosophy aspect.

If you choose to adopt the philosophy that usability is just making your project extremely functional, you could end up with an unusable nightmare that functions great. Or, if you choose to believe that making something with great form will be highly usable, you could end up with a beautiful app that looks one-of-a-kind that is completely unusable. It is the presence of all 3 tenets working together that makes your product a joy for the user to interact with.

That is not to say that being functional is not a key component of being highly usable. I choose to not even include it as a tenet as it is both expected and a byproduct of the implementation. If whatever you are designing lacks the literal functionality required for the user to do what they intend to do, obviously your product is not usable. And if you have the necessary functionality, but you lack any or all of the 3 tenets, it may be too difficult for the user to access that functionality. So if your question is "which comes first, functionality or usability?", the answer is yes.

<br/>
All of that sounds great, but what does that look like in practice? Here are a few examples of websites, programs, and apps that have zero, one, or two tenets:

### The Zeros (don't be like these)

#### Jira
![Jira website](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-jira.jpg)

I don't think it would take a lot of convincing to get most developers or designers to agree on this one. Jira is hard to use, inconsistent, has way too many features, and is not fluid to use. The visual weight of each page is staggering and the functionality of basic interactions varies depending on what page you are on or your permissions, which can also vary depending on what project you are in. Jira is so complicated that most companies pay for expensive training just to learn how to use the product that is supposed to be making them more efficient. Jira is also a good example that having a "clean" design with rounded corners and modern animations doesn't necessarily make your product usable. **Pretty â‰  usable!**

#### eBay
![eBay website](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-ebay.jpg)

eBay is still the largest online auction site and is able to outperform its niche competitors even though it lacks usability. There is nothing about eBay that screams minimalism, something its competitors that sometimes focus on a single product, such as shoes, can boast. eBay as a company likes to modularize their product updates, so as you are using the website, each page you navigate to can have its own design language, color scheme, etc. Furthermore, it only takes one trip to eBay's sizeable FAQ to learn that performing basic actions can be so obfuscated or complicated that users need to contact support.

#### Amazon

Online retailers rarely achieve minimalism, unless of course if they are in a niche market, which Amazon is not. Amazon uses lots of highly technical and expensive systems to combat its lack of usability such as using big data and AI to show you what you want before you even know what you want. However, the site and app both lack consistency and fluidity a lot of times. Amazon also combats these problems with competitive pricing and good habit design.

### The 1-2's (these are somewhat to mostly usable)

#### Poshmark
![Poshmark app](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-poshmark.jpg)

Poshmark is a great contrast to eBay, being a niche used item marketplace. The Poshmark app focuses on being fluid and consistent. Buying and selling work exactly how you would expect coming from any other marketplace app, but the buying/selling process has been optimized for ease of use. Listing an item for sale on Poshmark has so little friction as opposed to eBay, it can take less than a minute. Poshmark takes care of everything to do with shipping, unlike eBay and other marketplace competitors, which also factors into the fluidity of the sale.

#### Craigslist
![Craigslist website](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-craigslist.jpg)

Craigslist? Really?? In the 1-2's? You were probably expecting to see Craigslist earlier in the zeros section. Craigslist is commonly used as an example of bad design or lack of usability, but there is a reason why Craigslist caught on and is still a powerhouse with their intended demographic today. Craigslist may be an eyesore, but it could be argued that it is minimal in an effective/functional way, in addition to being extremely consistent. Craigslist is so much more consistent than a majority of its competitors that it easily retains its core users with no marketing or new feature releases. It is also really simple to use whether you are 65 and have never used the internet, or, you are 31 and have used the internet a lot coming with expectations of functionality.

#### Netflix
![Netflix app](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-netflix.jpg)

As the grandfather of streaming platforms, Netflix sets the bar for user experience in the mobile streaming industry. The fluidity of the experience when looking for something to watch or interacting with your selection is solid. The visual language of Netflix is minimalistic, even though its content library sometimes overwhelms users. The manner in which the content is presented focuses on tailoring to the user in a way that online retailers have yet to achieve. Consistency on Netflix, however, can be rare as features and layout are constantly evolving with no handholding to aid users' understanding of why the app isn't working the way it previously had, a common complaint within the rapidly-paced streaming industry.

### And what about the hat-trick? (this should be your goal)

#### Slack, Pinterest, Tinder, and Monday.com
![Slack, Pinterest, Tinder, and Monday.com](/assets/media/posts/defining-usability-the-3-tenets-of-user-friendly-software-design/usability-hat-trick.jpg)

As pictured above, I would personally consider Slack, Pinterest, Tinder, and Monday.com to be some of the most usable products I have seen out in the wild. Each company has nailed the stylistic and minimalist form enough to entice new users, but they also harness fluidity and consistency so much that they retain those users. They have become giants in their prospective industries while proving that good usable design and push you to the top in a red ocean. Some of them, in this case Tinder specifically, even introduced non-consistent interactions in such a well-implemented way that it has become consistent with other products. This proves that you can still be unique and introduce your users to new ways of thinking and interacting while maintaining a balance with usability.

<br/>
Now you may be thinking, how dare I not include other principles of good design such as clarity, familiarity, credibility, etc. All of those things are good, yes, but most other principles fall under one of the 3 tenets. If something is consistent, it is most likely familiar. I am not limiting consistency only to that of the website or app itself, but consistent with other websites and apps, aka what the user is already expecting. And if something is minimal and consistent, it is going to be clear to the user. It all boils down to being fluid, minimal, consistent. There are times you can color outside of the lines, for instance, if you are building a marketing website for a ground-breaking product or trying to showcase your design firms cutting-edge design abilities, building something familiar and consistent may not be of much importance to you. Or for Amazon.com, whose main objective is to sell everything under the sun, minimalism is unachievable. Minimalism is also a very relative concept, removing all but what is necessary, so you have some slack there as well. What is minimal to a day trading app is going to seem like overkill for a to-do list app.

Ultimately your goal should be to leverage the seemingly elusive concept of usability but not feel shackled. Having a philosophy to back up your desired result of being usable should be freeing and help aid you in design-related decisions. And once you can make a decision, user test, get feedback, then tweak as necessary.
