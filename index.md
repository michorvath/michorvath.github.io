                        <div class="item-description">After some trial and error, I managed to finish my first "real" game project and share it with the GameMaker Sandbox (RIP). The project was a poorly designed puzzle game called "Blinded by Sound" where the player controlled a dying cosmic light in a blacked-out world. To traverse each puzzle in the dark you had to use some of your light to send out echolocation-esque bursts of light that would expand outward temporarily lighting up obstacles in your path, but use this power too frequently and risk extinguishing your light. The game had far too many levels and wasn't all that interesting to play, but I finished it!</div>

Teamed up with one of my Lauren co-workers who would go on to work for Poppin, we designed and built an original web-based job finding site with a unique premise: chat roulette but with job interviews. Prospective hirees would be matched up with employers in real-time events for their 5 minutes of fame. A slew of complicated additional features caused scope creep that combined with a lack of funding sank this project before it had a chance to sail.</div>

After winning a lil green alien bouncy ball at an arcade with my best friend and watching an <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOlcB-JxkFw">inspiration GDC talk</a>, I bought my first arcade machine. A few days later I incorporated. Over the next 12 months, I bought and sold dozens of arcade games from all over the country.<br/><br/>I managed leases as I expanded my route and my dad helped me restore the machines I purchased to provide the best quality for my customers. Unfortunately, when you don't rig your games, charge very little, pay lots of "gambling" taxes, and give away high-quality American made prizes, you don't exactly make a killing.</div>

It is more effective, safer, cheaper, and much more fun than what is currently available in the market. The project is currently on hiatus but will be coming back in a big way soon.

I managed to get 10+ local businesses and organizations to help with the community event. A custom-built website hosted via AWS allowed hunters to input clues they discovered based on the hints that were posted on the scavenger hunts Twitter. Many strangers participated and the website received 200+ hits per day.<br/><br/>Clues were buried in concrete, hung from buildings, written on cakes, broadcast on the radio, and even stolen by unidentified college employees. While the event didn't quite unfold as planned, no one was hurt and no one got arrested, so I would call it a success!</div>
