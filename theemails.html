            <p>Rooftop,</p>

            <p>I miss you a latte. I understand the consequences of reaching out to you and I am as ready as I can be for them. Do whatever you have to do, nothing could be worse then never seeing you again. I just can't find the energy to focus and get through life anymore without you, it is too difficult. I don't care if you believe me anymore when I say it, but I still love you and you were a part of me and now that part is gone. I constantly feel anxious and like the best part of myself is lost forever. The pain is unbearable and you are irreplaceable. I'm sorry I failed you in every conceivable way. I am reaping what I sowed. I tried to move on... I really did... but I meant it every time I said you were my person. I miss the Richelle the rubbed shaving cream in my face and dressed up like a Rubiks cube. You were my favorite part of summer camp and I would spend hours practicing magic tricks just to show you after the Well. I miss you completely. I've never been good at pretending I'm okay and I have felt pain I didn't know I ever could over the last year. Every person in my life left because I wouldn't say you were a horrible person, or defend myself in court, or move on. All I ever talk about is our dumb memories and people get sick of it pretty quickly. Sometimes all I can think about is the fact that either of us could have been born at any time or place and we would have never met, and even without you in my life, I keep coming back to "what a gift it is to be alive at the same time". I will continue to pray for you even if you don't believe me or care but I need you to do whatever you are going to do because I can't take care of myself anymore.</p>

            <br><p class="text-center">----------------</p><br>

            <p>I don't think you read any of these and I have almost zero hope left that we will ever talk again but I have nothing left to lose at this point so I am going to keep on hoping (if by some chance you actually do see this and try to take "I have nothing left to lose" out of context as a threat or something I will be so disappointed. you know exactly what I mean). I wish I could hear from you and know all the amazing things you have been doing with your life. You are and always will be my favorite person on the face of the planet. You are so wonderful and used to be so loving and exciting, you made me feel more loved and valued than I ever have. You are irreplaceable Richelle. The memories we made give me so much comfort when the world keeps getting so dark. You have been working so hard to block all of them out that you probably don't even remember anymore and that's fair, you never watched Eternal Sunshine but you lived it. I rewatch old camp videos and random 180 things from time to time and see you and just remember how important you were to me.</p>

            <p>I still keep the water above the fridge because you liked it warm. And I only eat The Tonight Dough because it was your favorite when you would do Kent classes at my parent's house. I go to our bench every single day, it's dumb but it was where I decided I loved you, and it was where you decided you didn't love me anymore, so it is just a weird place to me now. I listen to Bon Iver so much, I never really cared about the lyrics when you would play him back in the day but now that I have been to Emma I understand the place that he sings about. I still have your gaming chair and our recipe box and really all of my "Richelle things". You used to say I didn't smile enough and I always hated my crooked smile so I got aligners and have been fixing it. I even got socks that weren't white so you couldn't make fun of me and say I wear dad socks ever again. I overcame my fear of heights and driving anxiety. I came out of my introvert shell a lot, mostly out of necessity. I funded a well in Cambodia and soon another in Ethiopia. I'm trying hard to be a living donor but it is actually way more difficult then you would think to give away your organs. I started a Bible study with a friend from Chicago and we Zoom every Thursday and are working through John. It's been alright. I gave our board games to a youth group because it just wasn't fun playing without you. Video games aren't really fun anymore, even movies. I've watched some without you but mostly I have lost interest and it feels so different.</p>

            <p>I miss you with my entire heart, Bible. I'm so sincerely sorry I am like this and drove you to hate me. I regret every mistake we ever made. I pray for you until I literally run out of words and become exhausted. You are the best thing that ever came into my life and I am so grateful for every single second I got to spend with you because it was an undeserved gift. I am pretty sure at this point that you do not want it, with the circumstances and all, but you will always hold my heart Richelle.</p>
